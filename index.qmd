project-description: "How does our understanding of Christianity shift when we recognize that for over half its history Christianity’s geographic center was not Rome, nor even Constantinople, but rather Baghdad? Stretching from Turkey, throughout the Middle East, across Afghanistan, down to India, up to Tibet, and into China, the Church of the East provides one of the richest examples of early globalism and Christian-Muslim encounters. Its adherents, however, usually wrote in a dialect of Aramaic called Syriac which only a handful of modern scholars can read. As a result, the Church of the East appears only rarely in modern scholarship. Professor Penn’s current book project, The Church of Baghdad, challenges modern perceptions of pre-modern religion by asking two interrelated questions: What changes if global Christianity began centuries earlier than commonly imagined? What must we change if our understanding of the increasingly popular phrase “the global middle ages” simply isn’t big enough to accommodate first millennium Christianity? To explore these issues, the project centers on a corpus of recently published letters from Timothy I, the person who—quite literally—brought the Church of the East to Baghdad."

In the 18th century, thousands of Northern Europeans traveled to Italy for a journey of cultural and symbolic capital that they called the Grand Tour. These travels were a formative institution of modernity and contributed to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, ideas about leisure, the market for culture, and the practices of professionalism. Since 2008, the Grand Tour Project (grandtour.stanford.edu) has generated digital tools, analyses, and visualizations to bring us closer to the diverse travelers who collectively represent 18th-century travel to Italy. We have been digitizing and enhancing John Ingamells’ Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800 to create a searchable database of more than six thousand entries. This past year the project’s focus has been on preparing this interactive database and an accompanying digital volume for publication with the title A World Made by Travel: The Digital Grand Tour for the Stanford University Press Digital Series. CESTA intern alumni Ashwin Ramaswami and Ryan Tan returned to the project to work on this exciting phase as we refined both development and design to satisfy the press’s guidelines, anonymous reviewers’ comments, digital accessibility, and best practices for digital sustainability and preservation. Raagavi Ragothaman, a CS coterm master’s student, also contributed in crucial ways, focusing on interactivity features and data visualizations.

## Subheading
For the project’s publication, we wanted to communicate immediately and clearly how the data for the more than six thousand travelers in the database is not only incomplete but also that this incompleteness is unevenly distributed. For any one traveler, we might have a lot of data about their journey but very little about their life—maybe not even their date of birth. We used the parallel sets visualization (originally created using Titanic passengers’ data) to convey this information showing at once the correlations among five dimensions across the entire database: 1) whether we had data about travelers’ dates of birth and death, 2) about their occupation and education, 3) the gender of the travelers, 4) how many data points (visits) we had for their journeys, and, finally, 5) whether the travelers’ entries were found in the original Dictionary, or if we newly created their entries in the course of the project as we recovered forgotten travelers.

### Sub-sub heading
The parallel sets offer an interactive visualization: by hovering over the various curved sections, the reader can appreciate how specific dimensions correlate in the database. This screenshot shows that by hovering on the yellow fine curved line in the last panel, you see that there are twelve women in the database for whom we have both birth and death dates, who had entries in the original Dictionary, and who are among the 2% of travelers for whom we have data for between 26 and 74 visits during their journeys.
