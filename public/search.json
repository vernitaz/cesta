Stretching from Turkey, throughout the Middle East, across Afghanistan, down to India, up to Tibet, and into China, the Church of the East provides one of the richest examples of early globalism and Christian-Muslim encounters. Its adherents, however, usually wrote in a dialect of Aramaic called Syriac which only a handful of modern scholars can read. As a result, the Church of the East appears only rarely in modern scholarship. Professor Penn’s current book project, The Church of Baghdad, challenges modern perceptions of pre-modern religion by asking two interrelated questions: What changes if global Christianity began centuries earlier than commonly imagined? What must we change if our understanding of the increasingly popular phrase “the global middle ages” simply isn’t big enough to accommodate first millennium Christianity? To explore these issues, the project centers on a corpus of recently published letters from Timothy I, the person who—quite literally—brought the Church of the East to Baghdad."

    "text": "Subheading\n  For the project’s publication, we wanted to communicate immediately and clearly how the data for the more than six thousand travelers in the database is not only incomplete but also that this incompleteness is unevenly distributed. For any one traveler, we might have a lot of data about their journey but very little about their life—maybe not even their date of birth. We used the parallel sets visualization (originally created using Titanic passengers’ data) to convey this information showing at once the correlations among five dimensions across the entire database: 1) whether we had data about travelers’ dates of birth and death, 2) about their occupation and education, 3) the gender of the travelers, 4) how many data points (visits) we had for their journeys, and, finally, 5) whether the travelers’ entries were found in the original Dictionary, or if we newly created their entries in the course of the project as we recovered forgotten travelers.\n  \n  Sub-sub heading\n  The parallel sets offer an interactive visualization: by hovering over the various curved sections, the reader can appreciate how specific dimensions correlate in the database. This screenshot shows that by hovering on the yellow fine curved line in the last panel, you see that there are twelve women in the database for whom we have both birth and death dates, who had entries in the original Dictionary, and who are among the 2% of travelers for whom we have data for between 26 and 74 visits during their journeys.\n  \n  \n  Sub-sub heading\n  Raagavi in a data analysis and visualization session discussing an early version of the parallel sets visualization with digital design professor Michele Graffieti, who visited CESTA last spring from DensityDesign Lab at the Italian Politecnico University of Milan—the best work happens collaboratively!"
